# GoTRouteFinder
Route Finding/Graph navigation application for the fictional map of Westeros and Essos from the Game Of Thrones Series.
(This application can be easily modified to suit any Graph,
provided with an adeqauate image for graphical feedback and appropriately structured XML file containing the Graph information)

Group project by Hubert Stefa≈Ñski and Niall Jordan

Key features implemented:

-GUI 

-Dijsktra's route finding algorithm

-Custom graph Data structure

-Multiple valid route permutations between any two nodes(Including avoidance and waypoints)

-Shortest/Easiest/Safest route permutations

-Graphical feedback(illustration of routes on the map)

-Waypoint through any node

-Avoiding any given node


TODO:

-Implement A* algorithm

-Reimplement Waypoint to be more reliable when finding any routes

-Rework Weighting system to reflect the state of the map more realistically
